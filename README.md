### introduction
The brief for this project was twofold:
1. Create a jupyter notebook looking at the matplotlib.pyplot package
2. Create a jupyter notebook analysing the CAO points data from 2019, 2020, and 2021

### contents of repositry
Included in this repositry are:
- **pyplot.ipynb** - a jupyter notebook discussing matplotlib.pyplot
- **cao.ipynb** - a jupyter notebook analysing the CAO points from 2019, 2020, and 2021 - cao.ipynb
- **READ.md** - this README file
- **requirements.txt** - file containing all of the python libraries used
- **data** - folder containing all of the relevent data files for the project
- **images** - folder containing all images used in the notebooks

<br>

### installation
![jupyter_logo](Images/jupyter_logo.png)
The jupyter notebooks require a python environment with all of the listed packages in the requirements.txt file installed. The easiest way to do this is with Anaconda which is available from here - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.

<br>

### run
Once installed, or the appropriate python environment set up, you can run the jupyter notebooks directly from `Terminal` (or whatever command line interface you are using). First you need to download the notebook locally, navigate to that location on Terminal, and then open the jupyter app by typing `jupyter lab`. The app will open in a browser window but runs on your local machine. To start you should click on the `kernel` menu and select `Restart Kernel and Run All`.  

The notebooks can also be viewed with `nbviewer` at the following link - https://nbviewer.org/github/Caoimhinv/Fundamentals_Assessment/tree/main/

<br>

### the notebooks
The notebooks are fairly self-explanatory. Each runs through the questions asked in the brief with appropriate visualisations. The reader is welcome to change any of the parameters to get a better idea of how it works.

### credits
A lot of the intitial work on this project was based on ideas covered in lectures with Dr. Ian McLoughlin. Further sources are listed at the end of each notebook
